# three-renderer

This package implements the **high-performance** THREE.js-based rendering engine for MLightCAD. It renders DWG/DXF entities as interactive 2D/3D graphics using advanced THREE.js optimization techniques to deliver exceptional performance for large CAD files.

## Key Features
- **High-performance** rendering of CAD entities as THREE.js objects with 60+ FPS
- Advanced batch rendering for optimal GPU utilization
- Custom GPU-accelerated shaders for complex line types and hatch patterns
- Efficient geometry batching and material caching
- Optimized 2D and 3D views, layers, and styles
- Memory-efficient rendering for large CAD files

## Performance Optimizations

The THREE.js renderer employs cutting-edge rendering technologies for exceptional performance:

- **Custom Shader Materials**: GPU-accelerated shaders for complex line types and hatch fill patterns
- **Geometry Batching**: Merges points, lines, and areas with the same material to dramatically reduce draw calls
- **Instanced Rendering**: Optimizes rendering of repeated geometries through instancing techniques
- **Buffer Geometry Optimization**: Efficient memory management and geometry merging for reduced GPU overhead
- **Material Caching**: Reuses materials across similar entities to minimize state changes
- **WebGL Optimization**: Leverages modern WebGL features for hardware-accelerated rendering
- **Rendering MText in Web Workers**: Renders mtext entities in multiple web workers
