- Modern UI optimized for large CAD file handling
- State management for layers, entities, and settings
- Integration with optimized SVG and THREE.js renderers
- Dialogs, toolbars, and command line interface
- Vue 3 component for embedding high-performance CAD viewers in your own apps

## When Should You Choose cad-viewer?

Use `cad-viewer` if you want a **ready-to-use Vue 3 component** for viewing and editing CAD files with a modern UI, dialogs, toolbars, and state management. This package is ideal if:

- You want to quickly embed a high-performance CAD viewer/editor into your Vue application with minimal setup.
- You need a solution that handles file loading, rendering, layer/entity management, and user interactions out of the box.
- You want seamless integration with optimized SVG and THREE.js renderers, internationalization, and theming.
- You do **not** want to build your own UI from scratch.

**Recommended for:** Most web applications, dashboards, or platforms that need to display CAD files with a polished user interface.

## Browser-Only Architecture

This Vue 3 component operates entirely in the browser with **no backend dependencies**. DWG/DXF files are parsed and processed locally using WebAssembly and JavaScript, providing:

- **Zero server requirements** - Deploy the component anywhere with just static file hosting
- **Complete data privacy** - CAD files never leave the user's device
- **Instant integration** - No complex backend setup or API configuration needed

- **Third-party friendly** - Easy to embed in any Vue 3 application without server-side concerns

## Directory Structure (partial)

- `src/app/` – Application entry, store, and main logic
- `src/component/` – UI components (dialogs, toolbars, status bar, etc.)
- `src/composable/` – Vue composables for state and logic
- `src/locale/` – Internationalization files
- `src/style/` – Stylesheets
- `src/svg/` – SVG assets

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mlightcad/cad-viewer
```

## Usage

Please refer to sub-package `cad-viewer-example` as one example.

### Basic Usage

Firstly, add the following dependencies into your package.json.

- @element-plus/icons-vue
- @mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer
- @mlightcad/cad-viewer
- @mlightcad/data-model
- @vueuse/core
- element-plus
- vue
- vue-i18n

Then create one vue component as follows.

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <MlCADViewer canvas-id="canvas" :background="0x808080" />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import 'uno.css'
import 'element-plus/dist/index.css'
import 'element-plus/dist/index.css'

import {
  i18n,
  MlCadViewer
} from '@mlightcad/cad-viewer'
import ElementPlus from 'element-plus'
import { createApp } from 'vue'

const initApp = () => {
  const app = createApp(MlCadViewer)
  app.use(i18n)
  app.use(ElementPlus)
  app.mount('#app')
}

initApp()
</script>
```

## MlCadViewer Component

The `MlCadViewer` is the main Vue 3 component that provides a complete CAD viewing and editing interface. It includes toolbars, layer management, command line, status bar, and various dialogs for a full-featured CAD experience.

### Component Properties

The `MlCadViewer` component accepts the following props:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `locale` | `'en' \| 'zh' \| 'default'` | `'default'` | Sets the language for the component interface. Use `'en'` for English, `'zh'` for Chinese, or `'default'` to use the browser's default language. |
| `url` | `string` | `undefined` | Optional URL to automatically load a CAD file when the component mounts. The file will be fetched and opened automatically. |
| `wait` | `number` | `10` | When set to a positive number, the component will wait for DWG converter ready to use for the specified number of seconds before initializing. This is useful when you need to ensure DWG file support is available before the component becomes interactive. Set to `0` or negative value to disable waiting. |
| `canvasId` | `string` | **Required** | Canvas element ID for the CAD viewer. The component will automatically call `initializeCadViewer` with this ID during its mount lifecycle. |
| `background` | `number` | `undefined` | Background color as 24-bit hexadecimal RGB (e.g., `0x000000` for black, `0x808080` for gray). |

### UI Settings

The `MlCadViewer` reads its UI visibility from the global `AcApSettingManager` (provided by `@mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer`). Configure these flags anywhere before rendering the viewer to customize the UI.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `isShowToolbar` | `boolean` | `true` | Controls toolbar visibility |
| `isShowCommandLine` | `boolean` | `true` | Controls command line visibility |
| `isShowCoordinate` | `boolean` | `true` | Controls coordinate display visibility |
| `isShowStats` | `boolean` | `false` | Controls performance statistics display |

#### Example (recommended)
```vue
<template>
  <MlCadViewer locale="en" canvas-id="canvas" />
  <!-- Or provide url/wait props as needed -->
  <!-- <MlCadViewer :wait="10" canvas-id="my-canvas" url="https://example.com/drawing.dwg" /> -->
  
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { MlCadViewer } from '@mlightcad/cad-viewer'
import { AcApSettingManager } from '@mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer'

// Configure global UI flags before the viewer mounts
AcApSettingManager.instance.isShowCommandLine = false
// Optional toggles
// AcApSettingManager.instance.isShowToolbar = false
// AcApSettingManager.instance.isShowStats = true
// AcApSettingManager.instance.isShowCoordinate = false
</script>
```

#### Notes

- Settings are global and immediately reflected by `MlCadViewer`.
- You can change them at runtime using the same `AcApSettingManager.instance` reference.
