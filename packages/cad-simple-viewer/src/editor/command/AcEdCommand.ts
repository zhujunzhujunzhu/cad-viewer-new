/**
 * Abstract base class for all CAD commands.
 *
 * This class provides the foundation for implementing CAD commands with:
 * - Command name management (global and localized names)
 * - Lifecycle event handling (command start/end)
 * - Execution framework with context access
 * - Event notification system
 *
 * Commands are the primary way users interact with the CAD system. Each command
 * represents a specific operation like drawing lines, selecting objects, zooming, etc.
 *
 * ## Command Lifecycle
 * 1. Command is triggered via `trigger()` method
 * 2. `commandWillStart` event is fired
 * 3. `execute()` method is called with current context
 * 4. `commandEnded` event is fired
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class MyDrawCommand extends AcEdCommand {
 *   constructor() {
 *     super();
 *     this.globalName = 'DRAW';
 *     this.localName = 'Draw Line';
 *   }
 *
 *   execute(context: AcApContext) {
 *     // Implement command logic here
 *     const view = context.view;
 *     const document = context.doc;
 *     // ... drawing logic
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Usage
 * const command = new MyDrawCommand();
 * command.events.commandWillStart.addEventListener(args => {
 *   console.log('Command starting:', args.command.globalName);
 * });
 * command.trigger(context);
 * ```
